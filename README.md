> **Scientific status (26 October 2026):** A three-line *notation-level* reconstruction of the established classical gauge-invariant Standard Model is given and specific symbolic consistency checks pass. This does **not** prove a new parameter-free theory or an equivalence with the proposed 39-strata lattice. The minimal three-generation Standard Model retains **19 physical parameters** when the strong-CP angle is counted.

## What this project does

The familiar Standard Model Lagrangian can span many lines when expanded into component fields and vertices. The same known theory can be written compactly in geometric language—gauge connections and curvature, associated matter bundles, a scalar Higgs field, and Yukawa morphisms.

The project supplies:

- A readable **three-line master Lagrangian**, with all hidden definitions spelled out.
- A standalone, responsive, dependency-free [research dashboard](index.html) with an interactive tree-level electroweak workbench.
- A technical [manuscript](three_line_standard_model_geometric_reduction.md) documenting the derivation, fermion representations, anomaly checks, parameter count, and limits of the geometric interpretation.
- A reproducible [Python/SymPy check suite](verify_standard_model_reduction.py) and its [recorded output](standard_model_check_results.txt).
- A conditional **39-strata internal-geometry hypothesis**, clearly separated from the established Standard Model reconstruction.

## Three-line classical Standard Model

With three generations, hypercharge convention \(Q=T_3+Y\), and repeated indices understood:

\[
\boxed{\begin{aligned}
\mathcal L_{\rm SM}={}&-\frac14(G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}+W^I_{\mu\nu}W^{I\mu\nu}+B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu})+\sum_{f\in\mathcal F}\bar f i\gamma^\mu D_\mu f\\
&+(D_\mu H)^\dagger D^\mu H-\lambda\left(H^\dagger H-\frac{v^2}{2}\right)^2\\
&-\left[\bar Q_LY_u\widetilde H u_R+\bar Q_LY_dH d_R+\bar L_LY_eH e_R+\mathrm{h.c.}\right]+\frac{\theta_3g_s^2}{32\pi^2}G^a_{\mu\nu}\widetilde G^{a\mu\nu}.
\end{aligned}}
\]

- **Line 1 — Gauge curvature + chiral matter:** the \(SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y\) field strengths and covariant fermion kinetics.
- **Line 2 — Higgs geometry:** Higgs kinetic term, scalar potential and spontaneous symmetry breaking.
- **Line 3 — Flavor and topological angle:** Yukawa matrices, complex mixing and the QCD \(\theta\) term.

This is an **algebraic rewriting** of the usual classical gauge-invariant SM, not a theory with fewer independent parameters. A gauge-fixed quantum formulation further includes gauge-fixing and Faddeev–Popov terms. In this minimal form neutrinos are massless; neutrino masses require an extension.

### Tree-level consequences

\[
m_W=\frac{gv}{2},\qquad
m_Z=\frac{v}{2}\sqrt{g^2+g'^2},\qquad
m_h^2=2\lambda v^2,\qquad
\sin^2\theta_W=\frac{g'^2}{g^2+g'^2}.
\]

The site has sliders for \(g,g',v,\lambda\) that **recalculate these identities locally in the browser**. They are not a parameter-free prediction, an experimental fit, or a loop-level renormalization calculation.

## What has been verified

The committed script performs **16 checks**:

| Class | Count | What it establishes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Yukawa hypercharge neutrality | 3 | Correct gauge-invariant charge combinations |
| Local triangle/mixed anomaly cancellation | 4 | Exact per-generation anomaly sums |
| Higgs and electroweak algebra | 5 | Scalar expansion, Higgs mass, neutral/charged boson relations |
| Parameter arithmetic | 1 | 19-parameter minimal-SM count |
| Errors in the original 39-strata infographic | 3 | Detects incorrect \(\sqrt{157}\), coupling arithmetic and mass-ladder claim |
| **Total** | **16** | **Targeted algebraic and consistency checks, not an equivalence proof** |

The graphic originally asserted \(\sqrt{157}=11.7047\), whereas \(\sqrt{157}\approx12.529964\); its displayed strong-coupling expression yields a different number than quoted; and a literal single-ratio fermion mass ladder conflicts with the electron–muon mass ratio.

**Independent physical predictions eliminated: 0** in the present 39-strata proposal.

### Reproduce the checks

Requirements: Python 3.10+ and SymPy.

```bash
python -m pip install sympy
python verify_standard_model_reduction.py
```

Compare with [the recorded output](standard_model_check_results.txt). Assertions are local algebraic checks; they do not establish physical equivalence of an unspecified geometric lattice.

## Physical parameter budget

| Sector | Number |
| --- | ---: |
| \(g_s,g,g'\) gauge couplings | 3 |
| Higgs potential \(v,\lambda\) | 2 |
| Quark and charged-lepton masses | 9 |
| CKM angles and CP-violating phase | 4 |
| Strong CP angle \(\bar\theta\) | 1 |
| **Total (minimal three-generation SM)** | **19** |

The gauge-group topology does not fix the three continuous gauge-kinetic normalization factors. Similarly, allowing an arbitrary internal overlap construction does not constrain the Yukawa matrices: without independently fixed profiles and operators, the same parameters have merely been moved.

## The 39-strata hypothesis: research, not result

A candidate finite internal geometry could generate flavor matrices through overlaps:

\[
(Y_f)_{ij} = g_*\sum_{k=1}^{39} w_k\,
u^{(f)*}_{L,i}(k)\,h_f(k)\,u^{(f)}_{R,j}(k).
\]

This is an **ansatz**. A meaningful reduction must:

1. Define an explicit graph and discrete Dirac/Laplacian, including symmetries and boundary conditions.
2. Derive the correct chiral matter and Higgs representation content, with anomaly cancellation.
3. Fix the coupling, spectral weights, eigenmodes and profiles **without using the observable being predicted**.
4. Freeze at least one observable prediction in advance and calculate the relevant renormalization/running.
5. Compare with experiment and seek independent replication.

Without those steps the notation is a model-building possibility, not evidence for parameter elimination.

## Website deployment

The site is entirely static and can be opened from `index.html`. The included GitHub Actions workflow deploys the repository root to GitHub Pages on pushes to `main`. If Pages has not previously been enabled, open **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → GitHub Actions**; the first deployment may require that repository-level setting. Check the Actions tab for actual publication status.

Criticism, attempted falsification, independent reproduction, and mathematical corrections are welcome. Please cite a concrete equation, an explicit failing calculation, and ideally an executable counterexample. Report scientific claims as **PASS**, **FAIL**, or **UNRESOLVED**, never as established solely because the notation is elegant or concise.
